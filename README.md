# Made by Will Taylor. These are not in any sort of order, but are just here for me to come back to.
## lab1
This lab is called Mustang Lights, and what this does is it connects to a monitor using VGA and displays the turn signals for
An old Mustang car.

## lab2
This is a project that I used to learn and check the timing of different kinds of adders. 
I used Quartus propagation delay and timing analysis to review and compare different types of Boolean adders.

## lab3
This is a simple LED program that I used to demonstrate to students how FPGAs can be used like an embedded system. 
This project simply changes LED lights into patterns. 

## lab4
This folder is a simple stopwatch that counts up from 0 to 9 and then repeats. This also includes a Clock divider if you want it to count slower, and a pause and reset button

## lab5 
This is the development of a full 4-bit CPU that currently lacks many functions. You will notice I have another CPU in another repo that is fully fleshed out and can run code. 
This CPU will always run the same operation, but can be adjusted with a more sophisticated FSM to execute code if needed.

## lab6
This is just a simple 16-bit memory space that was tested to see if the memory would work for a larger project
