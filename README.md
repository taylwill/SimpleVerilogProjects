# Verilog Mini Projects  
*Made by Will Taylor*  

Each of these labs is a small project to practice Verilog and test ideas for future implementations.  
They are **not in any particular order. I just uploaded them here after finishing, so I can access them on other computers.  
I also keep it organized with emojis, which is pretty awesome.

## 🚗 Lab 1 – Mustang Lights  
A VGA-based project that connects to a monitor and displays the **turn signals of an old Mustang car**.  

---

## ➕ Lab 2 – Adder Timing Analysis  
A project to learn and compare the **timing of different types of adders**.  
I used **Quartus propagation delay and timing analysis** to review performance differences between Boolean adders.

## 💡 Lab 3 – LED Patterns  
A simple LED program demonstrating how **FPGAs can act like embedded systems**.  
This project drives LEDs in **different patterns** for visualization.

## ⏱️ Lab 4 – Stopwatch  
A basic stopwatch that counts from **0 to 9** and then repeats.  
Features:  
- Clock divider (to slow down counting)  
- Pause button  
- Reset button

## 🖥️ Lab 5 – 4-bit CPU (Prototype)  
Development of a simple **4-bit CPU** that currently lacks many functions.  
- Always runs the same operation by default  
- Can be extended with a more sophisticated FSM to execute code  
- (Note: I have another repo with a fully fleshed-out CPU that can run code)

## 📝 Lab 6 – Memory Test  
A **16-bit memory space** project, tested for use in larger designs.
